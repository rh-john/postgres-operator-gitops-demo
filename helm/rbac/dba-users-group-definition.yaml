# OpenShift Group for DBA users
# This group provides centralized management of DBA user permissions
# Members automatically inherit cross-namespace read access to all dba-* namespaces
#
# IMPORTANT: After applying this YAML, you must also run:
#   oc adm groups add-users dba-users dba dba-dev dba-test dba-prod
#
# This command properly registers the users with OpenShift's internal group
# membership system. Simply listing users in the YAML is not sufficient for
# RBAC evaluation - OpenShift requires bidirectional linking between User and
# Group resources.
#
# The setup-dba-rbac.sh script handles this automatically.
